### Hi there 👋


I'm Utkarsh 😄 (he/him), a high school junior who's extremely interested in coding, startups and the evolution of technology! ⚡

I first started developping in Python 🐍 for a school project but my predilection for programming has grown ever since. Over quarantine, I got into competitive programming (mostly for thrill of solving a challenging problem!) and started learning C++ 🏎 mostly for its speed, especially compared to Python. That being said, I also enjoy coding in JS and (sometimes 😝) Java ☕.
