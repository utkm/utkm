I'm Utkarsh 😄 (he/him), a high school junior who's extremely interested in startups and the evolution of technology! ⚡

I've first started developping in Python 🐍 for a school project but my predilection for programming has grown ever since. Over quarantine, I started learning C++ 🏎 and also  enjoy coding in Java ☕ and JS ⚡️.
